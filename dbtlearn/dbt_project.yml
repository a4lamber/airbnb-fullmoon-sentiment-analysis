# Configuring models
# Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the example/
# directory as views. These settings can be overridden in the individual model
# files using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.

# 在dbtlearn/文件夹下的所有文件都会被视为view
# 在dbtlearn/src/文件夹下的所有文件都会被视为view
# 在dbtlearn/dim/文件夹下的所有文件都会被视为table
models:
  dbtlearn:
    +materialized: view # 设置默认的materialized 方法 https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/materializations
    +post-hook:
      - "GRANT SELECT ON {{ this }} TO ROLE REPORTER"
    src:
      +materialized: view
    dim:
      +materialized: table # 设置dim文件夹内的默认materialized方法为 table
